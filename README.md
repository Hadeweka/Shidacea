# Shidacea 2D Game Engine

What you see is the game engine Shidacea, decoupled from my game Inuhh Shinvasion 2.

This repository is a template for game projects. Depending on your level of knowledge and desire to mess around with my code, you can do several things:

* Just change the main mruby scripts and some configuration files to launch your game directly
* Change the core mruby scripts and add new ones
* Change stuff in the C++ wrapper files
* Dive into mruby and SFML and modify them
* Disassemble the whole thing, write some assembly code and segfault yourself into oblivion (not recommended)

Overall, this engine was designed to appeal to many people instead of a single group. 
However, a certain degree of knowledge about Ruby is needed.

# Idea and history

This project was inspired by the RPG Maker series from Enterbrain and complications with previous games written in Ruby. 
It aims to combine the beauty of Ruby for scripting with the speed of C++ for critical procedures while maintaining platform independency.

The original purpose of this engine was to serve as a backbone to Inuhh Shinvasion 2, but it quickly became its own thing.
Even if the original idea was to create a Jump'n'run game, it can technically be used for any 2D project.

# Requirements

The following programs need to be installed:

* Compiler with C++17 support
* CMake
* Ruby
* Bison

For Windows you need to make sure that the paths leading to ruby.exe and bison.exe are in the PATH variable.
CMake can be obtained using Visual Studio, which is the recommended option.
Also make sure to avoid path names with spaces in them, as mruby might fail to compile otherwise.

For the time being use "-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug" or "-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release" as option for CMake.
This will be fixed at a later time.

# Usage

There are two different ways to use Shidacea.

First, you can compile Shidacea without any scripts to a launcher.
If you want to execute a project of someone else, just download its script files and put them into the custom folder.

The second option is to compile your script files together with the Shidacea engine.
This allows for more optimized code at the expense of portability.

## Load scripts at runtime

Advantages:
* Platform independent projects
* Precompiled Shidacea engine can be used for common platforms
* After installing Shidacea, you don't need to touch it anymore

Disadvantages:
* Everyone can see and modify your code without effort
* Evaluating the script files takes longer than using bytecode
* You cannot change the Shidacea core

## Precompile scripts

Advantages:
* Faster evaluation of script files
* Obfuscated scripts
* You have full control over the engine and can change core aspects

Disadvantages:
* Your projects need to be recompiled every time you change a script
* You need to have at least basic knowledge about C++ compiling and CMake
* Your project needs to be recompiled for each platform


# Properties

* Platform independency (technically, but not tested yet)
* Scripting support using mruby
* Wrapped SFML classes for use with mruby
* Can be extended easily with mrbgems
* Modding support

# Features

* Simple event handling with pseudo-parallel routines
* Simple state machine for scenes
* Basic game classes and physics
* Intuitive and simple system for entity properties
* Simple entity scripting
* Wrapped ImGui methods for debugging

# Planned features

* More collision detection routines
* A special level editor written using this engine (will be called Hyashi)
* Separate example project

# Caveats

## Submodules

If you download this repository, make sure to download the submodules as well, since a simple download won't include them.
The best way to use Shidacea is to fork it and use Git for maintaining it and updating the submodules.

## Loading other mruby script files

The ruby instruction `require` is NOT available (adding it as a gem would be possible, but not applicable to the concept of pre-compiled bytecode).
This means that you need to write files with no direct dependencies, as they could be loaded in an arbitrary order.
Functions may reference other classes, but you should put inherited classes inside the file of their superclass.

The order of loading the script folders is: 
core -> custom/resources -> custom/scenes -> custom/entities -> custom/other -> custom/Game.rb -> custom/Main.rb

## Linux

This project should (read: SHOULD) run on Linux systems.
However, several libraries are required to do so (see documentation for SFML).

Tested distributions:
* WSL Ubuntu 18.04 (yep, it DOES work, but only if you install GCC 8 and all libraries required for SFML, and you also need an XServer)
* Manjaro 18.1.0 (works out of the box, only CMake was missing)
