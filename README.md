# Shidacea 2D Game Engine

What you see is the game engine Shidacea, decoupled from my game Inuhh Shinvasion 2.

This repository is a template for game projects. Depending on your level of knowledge and desire to mess around with my code, you can do several things:

* Just change the main mruby scripts and some configuration files to build your game
* Change the core mruby scripts and add new ones in the C++ core files
* Change stuff in the C++ wrapper files
* Dive into mruby and SFML and modify them
* Disassemble the whole thing, write some assembly code and segfault yourself into oblivion (not recommended)

# Requirements

The following programs need to be installed and inside your path variable (Windows):

* CMake
* Ruby
* Bison

# Features

* Platform independency (technically, but not tested yet)
* Scripting support using mruby
* Wrapped SFML classes for use with mruby
* Basic game classes
* Simple event handling
* Modding support

# Planned features

* Map routines
* Simple state machine for scenes
* Imgui support (if I can get it to work)
* Tiles support
* Game physics
* Basic game logic
* Implement 
* Collision detection routines
